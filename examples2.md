# SPOILER ALERT!!!

## Notable Stories in Capcom Arcade Vampire Savior

I have translated the following from Japanese to English. They are based on my recollection.

## Gallon

Gallon gets to return home after winning against himself. Yet he finds that there lies within him the longing for more.

## Sasquatch

Sasquatch defeats Jedah who, he thought, had imprisoned his kin. However, he learns that, on the contrary, his kin were treated kindly by Jedah.

## Bishamon

Bishamon gains more power upon defeating Jedah. However, a monk, who understands that his power lies in his demonic armor, seals it and frees the soul of the warrior that it had possessed.

## Victor

Victor gets to save little girl Emily with all his strength. When Emily wakes up, she finds Victor lifeless, but smiling.

## Anakaris

Anakaris gets everything for himself upon defeating Jedah. He decides to be the king of his own demonic kingdom rather than the king of everything for eternity.

## Lei-Lei

Chinese Lei-Lei becomes the strongest, only to wake up to learn that she had dreamt it. She goes off to tell her schoolmate about it as they both walk the streets of Japan happily toward home.
